		 * what is type casting?
		 * type casting is converting one data type to another data type
		 * why should i learn about type casting?
		 * so that we can use the code that is already written by someone else to make our life easier or 
		 * when we will be working in teams we will be able to merge the codes
		 * what is the syntax of type casting?
		 * when we are converting something smaller to larger we don't need to do anything it happens automatically 
		 * we just assign the variables for example
		 * int box=1234;
		 * 
		 * long box2=box;//this is how it works and it is called implicit or widening automatic 
		 * 
		 * however when we converting larger data type to a smaller data type we need top do type casting 
		 * and this is how we do it 
		 * 
		 * long box=12341234;
		 * 
		 * int bo2=(int)box;// this is called narrowing or explicit or manual conversion
		 * 
		 * 
		 *
